description: Check for pending messages from listen daemon
---

Check for pending messages that the listen daemon has queued. Execute this command:

```
nclaude pending
```

If pending messages exist:
- Display them in a readable format
- Note that these were queued by the background listener

If no pending messages, say "No pending messages."
